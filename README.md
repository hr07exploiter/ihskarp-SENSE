# ihskarp-SENSE
ihskarp SENSE utilises posenet to find the coordinates of finger joints, to create a 3 dimensional copy of hand which can be used to carry out medical activities like surgeries in remote locations in emergencies or in unavailability of local medical facilities.  As of now, we aim to use three cameras to process a three dimensional image of the objects. Initially, we are targetting to calibrate it for hand so as to simulate the actions, this can be used to carry out various task.  To use this application for medical purposes like surgery, we will need to keep a track of over 25 joints and the algorithm needs to be very strong. Thus it needs to undergo extensive training to get desired results. Another issue that we might encounter is processing data collected by the cameras to create 3 dimensional image that can be uderstood by the rootic hand present in the remote area.
